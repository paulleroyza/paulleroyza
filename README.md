### Paul Leroy ðŸ‘‹

I am a Google Authorized Trainer across 7 of the disciplines within Google Cloud. I am a Python dev at heart but grew up on Perl. I spend most of my time training and tend to focus on automation. Anything that has to be done more than once is worth automating. I train through [ROI Training](https://roitraining.com) and put many of the useful links in my repos here. Most of my production work is off github in Google's [Source Repositories](https://source.cloud.google.com) and not publicly available.
